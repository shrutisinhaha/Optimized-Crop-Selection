OPTIMIZED CROP SELECTION : A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE

India's economy and job market heavily rely on agriculture. The most frequent issue Indian farmers deal with is choosing their crops without considering the importance of soil, which causes them to experience significant productivity losses. Precision farming can be used to solve this issue. Three factors are taken into account by this method: crop yield data collected based on soil characteristics, soil types, and soil characteristics; the farmer is then suggested a suitable crop to cultivate. Along with the benefits of improved input and output efficiency and improved farming decision-making, precision agriculture also aids in the elimination of inappropriate crops, which in turn boosts productivity. This approach provides solutions such as utilising majority voting techniques in an ensemble model to provide a recommendation system. With high specific accuracy and efficiency, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbour can be used as learners to recommend an appropriate crop based on soil factors.<br>
The objective of crop prediction is to forecast the most suitable crop(s) to cultivate in a given area based on various environmental factors and historical data. This involves leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical models to analyze input features such as soil composition, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH, along with crop-specific characteristics.
